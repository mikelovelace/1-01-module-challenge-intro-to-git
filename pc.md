## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
    Git is a version control system used by programmers to track changes in source code.
    It keeps a history of all changes made to the source code, which allows a developer to
    reverse changes should any conflicts occur.
    This allows multiple developers to work togethor on one project in seperate branches 
    which eventually get merged into 1 main branch after all changes have been approved.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    Git is the version control system that tracks changes in the source code history.
    Github is a service to share code repositories and store remote copies of it as local backups.

3. Why do we create a branch?
    We create branches so any changes made to the source code only affect a specific branch.
    This allows a developer to make sure any changes made to the source code don't cause any 
    conflicts before merging the changes from that branch into the main code branch.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?


5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
